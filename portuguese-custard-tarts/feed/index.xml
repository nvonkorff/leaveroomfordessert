					<description><![CDATA[I made these for a neighbourhood Christmas party on the weekend and they were just divine!
I made them as instructed and they really were every bit as delicious as the ones sold in my local patisserie for $3 each!
I made an orange caramel (juice of one orange, 4Tbs brown sugar, reduce over a high heat for 10 mins) and spooned over the top and left to set - gave the tarts a real lift and complimented the flavour of the custard tremendously well.
The only thing I would advise is to not over-fill the cases with too much custard, which rises during the oven cooking and did overflow in a couple of tarts.
Won&#039;t ever buy these again now that I know how easy they are to make.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita,
My daughter (14) &#038; I enjoy cooking together (she cooks..I clean) she is adamant that we must follow a recipe to a T - which we did &#038; these turned out absolutely perfect! Thanks. No problems with the custard or pastry (puff) - fun to make! I&#039;m now in trouble &#039;cause I&#039;ve knocked off 3 of them while she is outside on the scooter...OOOPs!]]></description>

Hi Cathy
The pastry used in this recipe is just puff pastry - it can be found in the freezer section, sold in 6 sheet packets.
Hope you enjoy it!
Cheers
