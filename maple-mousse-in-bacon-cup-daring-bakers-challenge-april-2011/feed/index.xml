					<description><![CDATA[Great job on this month&#039;s challenge! Your bacon cups look perfect (mine were all over the place) and your mousse looks smooth and silky! Great job! Its a shame that you didn&#039;t particularly like them, especially after all the work that went into making this! Maybe it was the nut cup that helped to tie it all together?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It does look really good but i imagine i would agree with you on the taste! I think the cream would not really belong, if you were to stick to bacon baskets maybe some other ingredient to make it mousse like?]]></description>
