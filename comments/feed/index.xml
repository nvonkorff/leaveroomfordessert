					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita! I was just introduced to your blog today by your sister! Your niece is in my son‚Äôs kindy class! I just wanted to stop by and say hello to a fellow foodblogger, and also this caramel slice looks amazingly delicious! Loving the darkness of the caramel (the caramel layer in so many caramel slices is way too light-coloured; I much prefer the darker versions! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f601.png" alt="üòÅ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />)!]]></description>
