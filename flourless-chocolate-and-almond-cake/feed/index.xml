					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita,

I&#039;ve been making your cake for a few years now. I love it!  Everyone who eats it loves it! I even made it for my brother&#039;s GF wedding.

I bake it for 28 minutes so it&#039;s very fudgy and frost it with a vanilla buttercream.  

Thanks!
Carolyn in Chicago]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! (If you could answer this today, I would be very grateful!) 
My boyfriend&#039;s b-day is tomorrow and I&#039;m planning to make him this cake, but I want to include some fruit in it, something like bananas - he really likes them, and maybe a hint of oranges on the top?! I don&#039;t know if it affects the composition in some way, so I really need some advice! Thank you and have a nice day! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have just put this in the oven, for Ms 6&#039;s birthday party tomorrow. A friend commented today that they would probably not waste a cake like this on kids, with all the almond meal and so on. But i figure, I don&#039;t bake cake that often, I might as well make it good! 

Besides, I&#039;m trying to reduce our overall gluten intake. But really, this cake just looks too delicious to pass up! I am going to try your choc-a-block trifle next :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made this for a dinner party. It was a huge success. I skippednthe kahlua, used a mix of almond and flaxseed meal just to boost the health benefit and it was delicious.

					<description><![CDATA[Made this cake last night for hubby&#039;s birthday. He said it was my best chocolate cake to date. I enjoyed it as well. used recipe as per instructions omitting the kahlua...baked at 180 for exactly 40minutes. half the cake left today, and still very moist, soft. Im a celiac so this will regularily be a feature for my gluten free cooking. thanks :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Flourless cake is so popular now days because people are wanting a more thick rich texture to their cakes. I have had a few different types of almond cakes and almond is a great additive.]]></description>
