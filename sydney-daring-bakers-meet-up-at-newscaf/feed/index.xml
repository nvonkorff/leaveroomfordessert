					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s so funny you got a berry frappe. I had a craving today for a berry frappe. Just walked down to boost juice and settled for a berry sport smoothie. Last weekend I went to Bill&#039;s for the first time and got his pancakes. Yours look just as good. So bummed I missed this meetup. Hopefully I can make the next one. Would love to meet everyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This sounds like it was fun - and I love the look of your pancakes.  I was keen to attend if I could, but I had a non-negotiable family commitment  the same weekend.  I&#039;m hoping another will be organised so I can attend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aww such a shame I missed it! I would have loved meeting up with you and the others. Looks like you had a great meal and the serving of blueberries etc is very generous (but a little pot of extra real maple syrup never goes astray ;) )]]></description>
