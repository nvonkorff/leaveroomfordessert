					<description><![CDATA[My yiayia made her own filo dough from scratch. The resulting dough  ball was roughly the size of her fist. when she rolled it out, it covered the (large) kitchen table. The test to see if it was thin enough was if you could read a newspaper through it. :) I still miss her. She layered it with 6-8 leaves of filo as the base, then each sheet was lightly spread with the melted butter and about 1/4 c of filling, repeating till the top of the pan, where again, there were 6-8 sheets of filo layered with a thin spread of melted butter. While cutting most of the way through the filo (hint #1 in Melli&#039;s comment), she always used a whole clove pushed through the top center of the diamond shape, for structure and for flavor, and didn&#039;t use any ground cloves. It is a Turkish recipe, but since Turkey occupied Greece for hundreds of years, the Greeks made it Greek. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your baklava looks lovely!  Kudos for making your own phyllo.   Having grown up making baklava at least twice every year since I could stand at a counter, I will give you two bits of advice:  #1: Do not cut all the way through to the bottom of the pan.  Leave the bottom layer intact so the phyllo does not get soggy from the syrup.  #2: The syrup soaks into the pastry best if one is hot and one is cold.  It doesn&#039;t matter which is hot but one must be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your Baklava looks really good. I once worked with a Russian man whose wife made it for us all at work. The recipe was 2000 years old. It was amazing!! I have had Baklava many times at Resturants and nothing has ever tasted quite like that recipe. I always seearch for that same flavour though. Found your post on Pinterest. Have a great day! ~ Jamie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FYI - 
I often make Baklava (with store bought dough), but my recipie calls for a 12 oz jar of honey instead of making a syrup mixture. It gets drizzled on the  
same way after baking.  However, it tastes just a good and you don&#039;t have the runny syrup.  Might want to try it!  I&#039;m going to try the phyllo dough!]]></description>
