					<description><![CDATA[I would create a retro themed party. 

My cupcakes would be retro-y colors, like green, yellow, pink. The green cupcakes would taste like key lime pies, yellow, like lemon meringue, and the pink ones would taste like strawberry cream pies. Each would be frosted in REAL buttercream, with real butter.

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of a cocktail party, where the cupcakes themselves are flavoured as cocktails!  I would do a Pina Colada one, with a hint of yellow colouring, pineapple and coconut flavour, and a rich creamy coconut flavoured icing.. a Mojito cupcake, flavoured with lime, with pale green, mint-flavoured icing.. a Brandy Alexander cake, chocolate flavoured with a touch of Creme de Cacao, and a rich, creamy icing flavoured with brandy, topped with grated chocolate... a Strawberry Dacquiri cupcake, tinted pink with small pieces of real strawberry in it, topped with pale pink strawberry flavoured icing..  I&#039;ve got myself all excited about the idea now, I think I&#039;ll test out some of these ideas :)  Thank you for this competition, I would love to win!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm,  I would hold a &quot;An Evening with Julia&quot; party and decorate with a french theme in black and pink:)  I would serve french vanilla cupcakes with pink icing and decorate them with mini banners or cookies that say &quot;bon appetit&quot; or &quot;ooh la la&quot; :)  I just might do this!  :)

You had an amazing culinary year!!!  Cheers to 2010!

P.S.  Thanks for your comment on my blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It sounds like you&#039;re trying to re-gift your birthday present! Ha ha- just kidding.
I might host a casino-themed party with the cupcakes decorated with things like:
poker chips (using coloured liquorice)
dice (decorated sugar cubes)
the old school symbols from poker machines (cherry, pineapple etc. using lollies and icing)
feathers like from the casino show girls headpieces (prob. not great to use real feathers so maybe just paint on the top with icing?)


Wrt flavour, I&#039;d either flavour the actual cupcake OR the icing with: champagne (standard or pink) 
and, to mix it up:
martini (gin/vermouth- probably with strawberry to take the edge off).

Oh- and make the cupcake tree look like a roulette wheel!

Here&#039;s to another fabulous year of your blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A purple theme!

Plenty of balloons/streamers and flowers decorating the house and decorate the cupcakes with either purple or white icing, then do the opposite coloured flower on top!

Or a purple coloured croquembouche! ;)

Perfect way to celebrate my 30th!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love your site, have just found it and I too have a huge passion for baking and cooking and I love cooking for my family and friends. I too have an obsession with cookbooks and I love just pulling one off the shelf and &quot;reading&quot; it for pleasure.

I had planned a Winter Themed party for my son for June this year. I will be making Vanilla cupcakes with fluffy white italian meringue icing (to resemble snow) on top will be sugared almonds with their tips dipped in chocolate, with two tiny dots on them to resemble penguins and a tiny igloo made of sugar cubes on top. 
I love when my kids birthdays come round, making and decoration birthday cakes and watching the reactions of the guests is the best. Keep up the fantastic web site, cant wait to see what you add this year.
Bless you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year Anita!  Thanks for the round-up, great desserts and dishes, the pictures are amazing...I&#039;ll try to make the naan bread...as I was looking for a recipe to make them :-)
In regards to the theme, I think I&#039;d make like a garden theme, with all kind of flowers and garden bugs (I mean the cute ones).]]></description>
