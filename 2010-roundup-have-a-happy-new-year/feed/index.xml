					<description><![CDATA[My goodness what a beautiful round up of photos. Your year has truely been successful! Congratulations! The V8 cake is brilliant! Thank you for your concern. We are very much North of the floods though we did have a cyclone and major flooding on Christmas Day. However the water went down very quickly and our home is not affected by floods. Supermarket supplies are getting very low here though due to transport not getting through. Better than being in the midst of it, though!]]></description>
