					<description><![CDATA[Tried this recipe and it turned out well. Though the butterscotch filling sank to the bottom and after I baked the cake, the butterscotch layer wasn&#039;t as dark as yours. :( Will try to correct that the next time I make it because it tastes really good!! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/butterscotch-surprise-cake/comment-page-1/#comment-3095&quot;&gt;Organza&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Organza
A moderate oven is usually around 180C non fan-forced or 160C fan forced. It really depends a lot on your oven, as they differ so greatly.
Thanks

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Anita
thank you for this recipe.  I have 2 daughters living in London and only last week one asked for this recipe, as they were having a cake day at work.  When my girls (I have 3) were still at school, I used to make this cake a lot and it was their favourite.  I haven&#039;t made it for at least 10 years, and would you believe it, when they asked for the recipe, I couldn&#039;t find it.
The only difference in the one I made, was that I didn&#039;t have a ring pan, so made it in an ordinary cake tin.
Thanks again and I shall send this to the girls so they can enjoy it once again.
regards
Ruth]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love butterscotch - I must try this! What will happen if I omit the custard powder? Is there a substitute? I would like to try to avoid buying custard powder just to use two tablespoons in this recipe!]]></description>
