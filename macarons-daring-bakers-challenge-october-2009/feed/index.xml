					<description><![CDATA[I have tried 2 different recipes and they both failed! The first time made it with the french meringue, second italian. 

In both batches I used baking paper and no baking paper. The ones on baking paper looked horrible after baked. THe ones directly on the tray looked good, but there was a gap between the skin and feet! :( Both mixtures with and without paper were very difficult to remove!

I will attempt to make them again! Helen&#039;s recipe looks beautiful!~
I&#039;m excited for you to have made so much progress! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats with sticking with it!  I&#039;m sad to say that I gave up after two attempts.  The recipe from Tartlette  does look like it yielded the best result.  I will have to make that recipe my next attempt.]]></description>
