					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita
Just cooked the custard tarts Perfect.I love it when I follow a recipe as instructed and it works yours did .It is my first from your site so I intend to try a few (hard to choose)more. I do all the cooking for my wife and myself as a way to settle when I come home from my job as a builder.Next time you cook fried rice as you have stated (same as I do ) just sprinkle a chicken stock cube on top or a teaspoon of chicken powder an old lady at my Asian shop told me and it really does add something]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks all!

Hi Maria - I tend to put in anything I have lying around too - not that I often have bacon lying around... but I love it so much I make sure I have some.

Hi Trisha - hehehe, not sure that I like the rice that gets stuck very much.... :P

Hope you all enjoy creating your own fried rice :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought I was the only person to put bacon in their fried rice. I must admit though, I put anything that is in my fridge at the time into my rice. Not exactly the best fried rice, but it fills my tummy while emptying my fridge at the same time!]]></description>
