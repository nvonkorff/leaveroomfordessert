					<description><![CDATA[I am so jealous.  There are so many wonderful places to eat in Sydney.  This looks like a great day.  I&#039;ve not managed to &#039;connect&#039; with any other food bloggers in Brisbane yet.  Hopefully one day!  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was great to meet you on the day.
I slowly made my way through all 3 that I took home and the chocolates. 
I have to go back to try the rest... once I get over the sugar rush :)
Hope to see you soon]]></description>
