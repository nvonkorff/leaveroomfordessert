					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone
Thanks for all the comments!
I thought making a butter chicken pie was a little strange when Nick first suggested it, although it really works well.

Shez - I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only one who gets told &quot;anything&quot; when asking what someone wants. I bet you had a great dinner with a variety of Mexican foods.

Lorraine - Thanks for the Happy Birthday message for my mum - she had a great night.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of making this into a pie. Curries with delicious gravy really lend themselves to the pie medium-yum! Happy Birthday to your mum :)]]></description>
