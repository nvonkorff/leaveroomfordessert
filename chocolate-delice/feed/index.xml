					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Great job with the recipe... 
The recipe on the master chef website is actually completely wrong which is propbably why you had so many troubles with it!!
They missed a lot of the steps.

I have just finished doing my recipe to set it straight and putting it on http://eamoneats.blogspot.com/ if you want to see the difference!

someone forwarded me this site saying it was already on the web! Good job.

					<description><![CDATA[Great job on this dessert! I put this in the &#039;too hard&#039; basket to make at home - and I am an ex pastry chef. I don&#039;t know why some people omit steps in recipes, it may be genuinely that they were forgotten, as there is an assumption of technique, or just plain meanness (chefs can be insecure). 

i have just impulsively bought some 10 cm stainless steel rings and have been pressured by the family to make this dessert. 

To bake the brulee in the moulds, you could wrap the bottom of each of the rings with glad bake or foil (twisting the paper up the sides to form a seal), and that way you could bake the brulee mix on top of the cut out biscuit, but it would need to be used quickly, as it would go soggy. But then you could pour the chocolate mix on top to set, then use a blow torch to heat the sides and pull off.I might try this and advise how it works...]]></description>
