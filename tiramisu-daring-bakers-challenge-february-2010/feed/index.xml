					<description><![CDATA[This dessert looks wonderful - like the others, I love the cone shape, and I will steal this idea for the future.

Years before Tiramisu became a household word, I used to make a Marsala Log, which basically operated on the same principle but with different flavours. You dipped Choc Ripple bikkies in marsala then stood them up sandwiched with choc cream. Then I discovered you could make the log with gingernut biscuits, and preserved ginger through the cream.

My point is, there is a sort of basic style of dessert which involves dipping some kind of biscuit/cake into some kind of liquid and layering (either vertically or horizontally) with some kind of flavoured cream. And that means there are endless possibilities, and therefore no condemnation of choosing not to have coffee!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have made varied versions of tiramisu ... love the full coffee/rum version but a great alternative is rasperberry and limecello, with a white chocolate pastry cream.  have to say its always a winner.

Thanks for the marscapone recipe - am off to try this in the weekend!]]></description>

Coffee &#038; chocolate! Mocha anyone? :)

Lovely post. Always a pleasure to visit.
