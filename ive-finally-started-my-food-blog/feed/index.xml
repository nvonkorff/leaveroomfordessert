					<description><![CDATA[Hey anita, cool blog and sweet idea of combining your family&#039;s expertise- I remember their wonderful catering abilities at your engag-ment party. 
Just wondering, is there any way of getting the food through the internet into my mouth? I like the look of those portugese tarts! Otherwise I&#039;ll just have to make them myself!

Hi Goober boy
I&#039;ll be updating my blog soon with some recipes, as I&#039;ve only just started blogging and designing the site, so check back in a little while.

Hi Nick
I&#039;m pretty sure the food at your wedding was equally as nice as mine.
Thanks for your help with my blog - and our food too!]]></description>
