					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much.  I decided to make this after seeing it on Masterchef and I&#039;m so happy that I came across your link.  I live in the US and we don&#039;t use the metric system (unfortunately).  So I think that if I made this according to the original recipe that was posted, it wouldn&#039;t have turned out and I would have believed it was because of problems with converting grams to ounces, etc.  I made this updated recipe and it came out beautifully and tasted delicious!]]></description>
