					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita - Natalia has put me on to your website. LOVE IT!

I am wondering why - with the risotto - you cover the baking dish with foil, and not just put a lid on it?  I put a lid on mine last night and it worked &quot;OK&quot;...but I probably over cooked it....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A baked risotto is so much easier than the other, stirring method! I am not one to complain, though, as I use pre-cooked rice that you just dump into a pan with the other ingredients.  Your recipe sounds delicious, so I will definitely give it a go.]]></description>
