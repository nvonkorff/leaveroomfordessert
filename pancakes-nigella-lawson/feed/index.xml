					<description><![CDATA[this is another one of nigella&#039;s pancake recipes. i am a huge fan of hers. i&#039;ve made this so much that i have it off the top of my head. couldn&#039;t find it online. it&#039;s printed and at home and i&#039;m not in that home now.
NIGELLA&#039;S AMERICAN PANCAKES
100g plain flour
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp sugar
1 egg
125ml milk
15-20g butter
cinnamon
pinch of salt
serve with bacon if possible 

put the first 3 ingredients in, break an egg into it, mix together, add the milk but stir as you put the milk in so no lumps form. have the butter melted; i use the microwave so it&#039;s soft or runny. once the milk&#039;s completed mixed into the batter, add the melted butter and pinch of salt. i sprinkle cinnamon. can add apple slices cut small or grated too. i&#039;ve done that too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all your comments :)

Hi Lorraine - Yeah I wonder too, I&#039;ve tried a few recipes since that one, so it&#039;s difficult to remember it to be able to describe it a bit more.

Hi Y - I guess others help you get your pancake fill then :)

Hi Leela - I&#039;m not sure what kind I have, but that&#039;s a good idea for next time - thanks!

Hi Maria - I like the sound of your buttermilk pancakes, perhaps I can get the recipe? :)

Hi Julia - Oh, maybe I should try those substitutions... I&#039;m sure it would turn out lovely! Thanks for your suggestion!

Hi Arwen - I guess I will have to try some more.... shame :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It seems like such a nice simple recipe, so it&#039;s a shame the taste wasn&#039;t quite right.  You&#039;ll have to try some more recipes ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very strange about the taste.  I lived in the US for almost 5 years and pancakes were certainly big business.  I would make them frequently and would always go the buttermilk pancake.  They are so incredibly light and fluffy.  I can&#039;t remember the exact recipe now (hardly make them since I&#039;ve been back) but I think pretty much if you switched out baking powder for baking soda, and milk for buttermilk you would be close.  Good luck with your pancakes.  I know what it&#039;s like to try a million recipes for something!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anita, these pancakes look really good. I wonder too what it was that caused the odd flavor. Like you said, it could be from the baking powder. Have you tried using the non-aluminum kind?]]></description>
