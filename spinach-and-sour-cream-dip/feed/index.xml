					<description><![CDATA[I love this dip. I make it all the time its the only way to get my 4 young children to eat spinach. However my recipe is different I&#039;ve never added cheese. Yours is the first where I&#039;ve seen it in the list of ingredients. Next time I&#039;ll give it ago . Maybe it will make the perfect dip even better ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/spinach-and-sour-cream-dip/comment-page-1/#comment-2229&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey Sarah
I&#039;m really not sure of the origin of this dip - all I know is it&#039;s loved at most parties I go to (and it&#039;s not me making it most of the time).
Just had a quick check for any info about the origin - but no luck. I&#039;d love to find out if anyone knows the answer :)
Thanks
Anita]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this for an afternoon tea yesterday and it was a hit. I used light sour cream (as it was a girly affair!) which worked well. Am also keen to try this recipe with mozarella instead of tasty cheese.

PLUS, two friends commented that it was similar to a dip that they had had as part of Jewish and Sri Lankan meals. Do you know what the origin of the dip is?]]></description>
