					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on your persistence! It took me a while to realise how long it takes for sourdough bread to rise ( like 5 hours!). And I killed 2 of my starters but after a while you realise they like a lot of warmth and sometimes need to be fed more often. Good luck! Though I not sure I would make sourdough all the time I still enjoyed it and have my starter still going.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on your first loaf! It looks pretty good! Just keep feeding it and it will get better. And try a different recipe, I found that the given recipe was a hard one. Check out Wild Yeast and Bewitching Kitchen for some good loaves, that is where I usually get my recipes from. And remember to keep your dough nice and toasty warm while proofing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It looks pretty good, especially with the mushroom topping!  Sourdough can be so tricky.  It took me about a year to finally get my starter to raise itself.  I had no idea what was wrong with my starter until one day I started using a different brand of flour and suddenly my starter got lots of energy!  Just keep experimenting, you&#039;re on the right track!  :)]]></description>
