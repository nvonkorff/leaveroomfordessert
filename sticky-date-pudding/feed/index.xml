					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone :) Thanks for your lovely comments!

Hi Zita - Hehe :) Thanks, I&#039;ve been enjoying making the dishes, but have a heap more to make.

Hi Zina - Definitely make this, and the custard from the Croquembouche if you don&#039;t want to try the whole thing.

Hi Anita - The ramekins are Maxwell Williams ones, I got them a few years ago at Myer.

Hi Belle - :) I&#039;ve seen a few other recipes from MasterChef, I can&#039;t wait to try them.

Hi Lorraine - The praline was a lovely addition.

Hi Y - hehehe, exactly!

Hi Julia - Thanks, and I agree too.

Hi Sophia - Really?! Well, I hope you try it!

Hi Trisha - Mmmm.. ice cream went well with it, and I love butterscotch sauce, so it was a fantastic dessert!

Hi Clekitty - Thanks! :)

Hi Maria - Hmmm, it was nice and moist, not too sticky.

Hi Howard - It is a bit old school, isn&#039;t it... It was my first time at this though and it was great.

Hi Arwen - Thanks!

Hi Parita - :) thanks heaps.
