					<description><![CDATA[The major celebration occurs on the Eve of Christmas. My family attends Christmas Eve mass together and then gather for a grand family dinner which we call, Noche Buena. 

In this festive season, we always adorn our windows with &quot;Parol&quot;, Christmas lantern influenced by the Mexican Pinata. Christmas is never complete without the Christmas tree filled with decorative pieces and colourful lights!

On Christmas eve, my family members partake a sumptuous meal by twelve midnight, called Noche Buena.   This usually comes after we attended a late evening mass or church service.  

My favourite Christmas recipes are &quot;Bibingka&quot;, Filipinos rice cakes made from rice flour topped with carabao cheese and grated coconut and  &quot;Puto Bumbong&quot;, purple glutinous rice cakes steamed in bamboo cylinders and sprinkled with grated coconut and brown sugar.

Happy Holidays! Cheers! =)]]></description>
