					<description><![CDATA[Hi Arwen - Yep, I think dessert would be bigger winner for me :)

Hi Steph - I know what you mean about wine in a sauce too - it just adds &quot;something...&quot;. And talk about talking the meal up, propose-worthy food should be to-die-for food :)

Hi Alexandra - Hope you like the recipe and use up a bit of your leftover vodka :) let me know how it goes.

Hi Lorraine - He he, Nick doesn&#039;t&#039; seem to say it had anything to do with the proposal..... but maybe in the back of his mind it did :P

Hi Maria - It was a first for me too! It doesn&#039;t add as much flavour as you would think, just an underlying subtle &quot;something&quot;.

Hi FFichiban - :P I Know! he he, the vodka must have been more than double the recipe :) Hope you give the recipe a go!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha that recipe gives quite a big promise to live up to! I&#039;ve never tried putting vodka in a pasta sauce but I can relate to what you say about it feeling like something is missing without it-like how adding wine to a sauce seems to give it extra depth.]]></description>
