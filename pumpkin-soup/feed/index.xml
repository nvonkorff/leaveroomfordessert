					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments everyone!

Hi Cecilia - This is a great and adaptable recipe. I hope you enjoy it.

Hi Lorraine - Yep, more dessert is definitely a plus!

Hi Arwen - Even though I&#039;m not looking forward to really cold days, I am looking forward to the soups in Winter.

Hi Beta Gal - The only other recipes similar to this might be a potato and leek soup. I&#039;ve also had a cauliflower soup which is pretty much cooked cauliflower with some stock, which is then blended. Otherwise you could make a chunky vegetable or minestrone soup, which require a few more ingredients. I&#039;ll probably be trying out a few more recipes as we get into Winter, so I&#039;ll let you know how they go.

Hi Sara - I&#039;m not quite sure what sort of pumpkin puree you would have, as I would consider this to be a pumpkin puree. If it&#039;s just pumpkin and a bit of water, perhaps you could just add a bit more water to make into a soup.

Hi Barbara - The hand blender works so well in the pan and you don&#039;t have to transfer it  - which is a plus!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this sounds easy enough for even me. I&#039;m not as fond of pumpkin soup as some others. Can you adapt this recipe for some other vegies? Do you have any other recommendations?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, it&#039;s imperative to balance healthy with the unhealthy and one of the best things about such a healthy, sustaining soup is that you can eat more dessert! :P]]></description>
