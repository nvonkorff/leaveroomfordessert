					<description><![CDATA[I know you wrote this a while ago, but thanks so much for posting it!  I used your basic design (but without the feet) to create a cake for my daughter&#039;s owl-themed first-birthday party and it turned out great!!  :)

Here is a link to it on my blog so that you can see a picture: http://itsmombojumbo.blogspot.com/2013/04/pearls-first-birthday-bash-recap.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita, 

Love this cake so much, am going to try it out for my daughter&#039;s first birthday. Am a bit of a novice at these things but what type of icing do you use for this? Butter cream icing? 

Fingers crossed mine will looks something similar to yours! 

Thank you for the fab cake idea! x]]></description>
