					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita

I am Carol from Sydney Australia, enjoying your recipes and have passed the site to my daughter. 
I made the sticky date pudding and butterscotch sauce for dessert - yum. 
My son and son in law loved it. Unfortunately my daughters are on diets so missed out. I love making desserts and spicy foods as well. I have a question to ask .. Are Graham crackers available here in Sydney Australia? I have noticed these are used in recipes. Also are these things they call biscuits similar to scones and would they be available here as well.

Thanks for all the beautiful recipes]]></description>
