Hi Arwen
As there is baking paper on the bottom of the ramekins, all you need to do is slice a knife around the edge, put a plate on top of them and turn it over. They should come out fine - unless, like me, you under-cook them, in which case they will definitely fall apart :) .]]></description>

I have made the recipe four or more times now, and only once have half the cakes turned out cooked to perfection. I often have to cook for minute or two longer than the recipe states, but I often forget to and they turn out like liquid chocolate - although I don&#039;t hear many complaints :P .]]></description>
