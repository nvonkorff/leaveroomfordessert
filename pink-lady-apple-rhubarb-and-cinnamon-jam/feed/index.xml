					<description><![CDATA[Great recipe! I&#039;ve made it three times now, first for myself, and twice recently to put jars into Xmas hampers for family. Each time it has been a resounding success (except that the second time my damn candy thermometer broke in the mix, leaving glass shards through it. A major disappointment as I think that was my best jam batch so far, but it had to be discarded.  Not the fault of the recipe though!). Anyway, just wanted to say thank you for sharing this great recipe - it&#039;s fantastic to find a jam that is easy to make and not sickly sweet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made a double batch - so yummy. I didn&#039;t have enough rhubarb, so I just used more pink lady apples to get the right quantity of fruit. Thank you so much for this lovely recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Kate - Whoops! Sorry, can&#039;t believe I left it out! Feel free to add more cinnamon if you like, but 1 teaspoon is quite subtle and nice. Thanks for visiting!! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the colour it turns from the rhubarb! Sounds like a combination of flavours that would work together perfectly. Those are adorable jam jars by the way, very cute :)]]></description>
