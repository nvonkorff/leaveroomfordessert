					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m probably never going to get to Quay- but I loved reading about it through your eyes.
That chocolate cake is extraordinary looking! But then just about all your photos were intriguing! The menu looks varied and unusual.

					<description><![CDATA[MMMMMmmmm. That is the most exquisite meal I&#039;ve seen in a long time. I&#039;m especially impressed by the snow egg, I have no idea how they would create something like that. Sounds like the flavours of the entrees and appetisers were nice and subtle too, which is something I particularly enjoy.

Glad you had such a special night.]]></description>
