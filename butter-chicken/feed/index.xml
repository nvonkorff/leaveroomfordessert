					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I will have to try this recipe one day also you are great at what you do you should really do this as a living if you dont already. I have a butter chicken recipe which is similar but uses peppercorns cloves bay leaves  Tomato onion cream fenugreek leaves for the curry. tandori masala greek yoghurt ginger and garlic for the marinade for the chicken and you bake the chicken in the oven. Maybe you could try that one out? 
Not trying to tell you how to cook though you obviously know how :)]]></description>
