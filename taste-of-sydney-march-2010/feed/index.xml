					<description><![CDATA[Great review! I went on Friday night too. Shame I didn&#039;t know you were going. Would have loved to meet you. I also highlighted the menu before I went. I tried totally different things to you. I was planning on going to the Taste kitchen first but I made a sporadic decision to go to the wine tasting session on wines to complement spicy food and it was great.

Loved the wobbly boob from Jonah&#039;s too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful review!  The artisan bread looks superb.  And I&#039;d love to try those wagyu burgers!  I wouldn&#039;t even know where to begin with all those desserts - good thing you brought friends to help taste test!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this kind of post, Anita! It truly does introduce us to the taste of Sydney. And it&#039;s pretty smart of the chefs to take part too...it&#039;s a surefire way to get entice people to your restaurant.
Of course, as always, the desserts would have all my attention! The vanilla panna cotta looks divine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A masterful and very informative review.  Made it seem like I was there with you. A good suggestion to the organisers about offering more free tastings.  It is the best way to get an unbiased opinion of a product.]]></description>

Those little burgers are almost as cute as the cygnet!]]></description>
