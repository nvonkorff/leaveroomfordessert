					<description><![CDATA[Great article Anita! I too share a love of Dukkah...such a simple crowd-pleaser when it comes time to entertain guests.

Our family has experimented with including additional spices that give our standard Dukkah more of a Moroccan flavour (cinnamon, ground cloves, allspice, cayenne pepper, ground ginger) and with great results. Nowadays we usually just cheat by adding pre-packaged Moroccan seasoning mix :). Still tastes amazing! Hard to go wrong with a good Dukkah I suppose.

Keep the great articles coming! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone!

Hi Arwen - Thanks! The pistachios give a splash of pretty green to the mix - and taste great!

Hi Lorraine - It&#039;s a great recipe, very similar to what I had at the restaurant. Looking forward to making some different recipes.

Hi Leela - I hope you try it!

Hi Alexandra - It&#039;s not heaps common, I don&#039;t see if around much. Hope you like it!

Hi Beta Gal - Thanks! It didn&#039;t really sound like something I would eat either, but glad I did. I don&#039;t see it at heaps of restaurants - I have a little left over if you want to try some? :) 

Hi FFichiban - Thanks! It&#039;s a lovely combination of flavours :)

Hi Jeena - Hehe, glad someone else searches for recipes once they&#039;ve tried something :)

Hi Ann - Great to hear it&#039;s new to many people, hope you try and like the recipe!

Hi Barbara - Thanks, I like my cute bowls :) . You&#039;ll be able to make it for much cheaper than anywhere would be selling anyway :)]]></description>
