					<description><![CDATA[Oh my - these are my absolute favourites! I didn&#039;t realise they were so easy to make. Off to the supermarket for almonds tomorrow...!
(and by the way, choc brownies are a very close second favourite of mine!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anita - PERFECT.  I love these biscuits, too.  I think there are a few variations around from different countries.  They seem to have similar ingredients and techniques but just different shapes, e.g. Mexican Wedding Cookies.  My favourite part is the tossing in icing sugar.  Always fun.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone

I&#039;m glad everyone else loves these biscuits. I&#039;m not sure of the origins of this recipe, but have seen a Greek recipe which I want to give a go and compare it to.

Hi Belle  - yep, I just roll them into a log shape (like the ones on the other tray -  except maybe a little longer) then just push the edges together slightly and they will stay and cook in that shape. My mum is better at making the crescents, but I&#039;m getting a bit better and the icing sugar covers them up anyway :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These biscuits are such a classic, and yours look wonderful.  Obvious question, but how did you get the crescent shape - just roll them?]]></description>
