					<description><![CDATA[it looks amazing so I decided to follow the recipe and make it. had a problem though making the marshmallow mouse!! 

I have attempt half the recipe and when I left the melted white chocolate and marshmallows to cool, it became elastic and rubber look form. I made another one and just before it turned elastic i thought I will fold it with the whipped cream, but it didn&#039;t incorporate well. not sure what i am doing wrong. 

appreciate your help.]]></description>
