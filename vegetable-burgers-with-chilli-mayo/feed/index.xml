					<description><![CDATA[With chickpeas and sweet potato they must be good! You&#039;re right that they&#039;d be a great backup in the freezer, but I guess that might make them even more fragile.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The last time I  made a veggie burger, it fell completely apart in the pan. It was good, but it stopped me from trying again. Perhaps this is common. I like the ingredients in yours and am tempted to try again.
(Are those sweet potato fries I see?  Yum!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once bought veggie burger &#039;mince&#039; that basically consisted of refried beans. I don&#039;t know how the manufacturers got the consistency to be firmer, but when these were fried they had a crisp outer layer and a soft middle. I&#039;ve liked them better than any other veggie patty I&#039;ve tried. Unfortunately I&#039;ve never seen them again.]]></description>
