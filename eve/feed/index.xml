					<description><![CDATA[Great minds think alike!  I made Eve this week as well but as my belated birthday cake to take to work (my post will be up next week).  Your version looks great and I am very jealous you have done a course at Savour as it is on my wish list.  I didn&#039;t end up attempting the mushrooms and chocolate leaves as I ran out of time but the whole thing was very tasty.  Have a great weekend :)]]></description>
