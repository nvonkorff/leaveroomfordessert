					<description><![CDATA[I have been meaning to make crossiants for ages. I read an article recently in gourmet traveller on making them but their steps weren&#039;t very well explained! I shall have a go with your recipe. I just want to slop jam over these and eat them all up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your croissants look utterly amazing! Great job! I would love to have them for breakfast almost every morning, too. But seeing as how the 12 I made barely lasted a day, I would be spending all day every day baking them! :) And congrats on getting a new (to you) granite countertop!]]></description>
