					<description><![CDATA[One of my favourite Greek sweets! I started baking it last year but I must admit that yours look delicious! I have also tried to half cover them in chocolate, it makes them even naughtier!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone for your comments, I agree that the oil to flour ratio does make me feel better about the quantity of oil used. The flavours are lovely and the sweet syrup is gorgeous, it&#039;s like biscuits and baklava mixed together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yummo!!  These looked great.  I don&#039;t seem to be scared off with cups of butter or oil in sweet food, but for some reason it scares me in savoury food.  Go figure?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How interesting - when I first begun baking, it was the opposite for me! What&#039;s a cup of oil, I thought, it&#039;s just liquid right? :) But I do love baking with oil, particularly in carrot, banana or spice cakes, the resulting texture so moist. I can&#039;t recall having used them in biscuits yet... hmmm, looks pretty inviting!]]></description>
