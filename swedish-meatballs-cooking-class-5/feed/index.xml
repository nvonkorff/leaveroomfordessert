					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments!

Hi Steph - I&#039;ve just heard great reviews about the meatballs at IKEA, I must try them. The only time I went to IKEA I spent all my time shopping and no time eating!! :(

Hi Lorraine - I love the sauce too! I can&#039;t believe how good it was :) Home-made should surely be better, although I haven&#039;t tried IKEA ones... yet :P

Hi Arwen - I was surprised at the timing too! We made these last week and I finally got a chance to post them and heard everyone talking about the ones at IKEA. Maybe anyone who can&#039;t get in there can try make their own :)

Hi Alexandra - Lucky you! I only just tried these, would have loved someone to make these for me earlier :)

Hi FFichiban - :) I thought you just had meatballs at IKEA? :P Hehehe Thanks!

Hi Julia - Hehe, I won&#039;t tell your partner :P Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve timed this recipe perfectly after the Ikea crowd talking about their Swedish meatballs.  I like your idea of putting caramelised onions in the mashed sweet potato!]]></description>
