					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/easy-chocolate-brownies/comment-page-1/#comment-3006&quot;&gt;Jan&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Jan
These absolutely work when halved. I always make two trays worth, so I&#039;ve put the doubled amount in so I don&#039;t have to double everything while I&#039;m baking :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to comment on my earlier comment:

Having watched &#039;Poh&#039;s Kitchen&#039; on the ABC, I now know that it is important to properly beat the sugar and the eggs as otherwise they start to cook each other! So, listen to Anita and not to me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yay! This recipe is finally up!

This is SUCH a good recipe - I shamelessly requested it from Anita and cook it at least every fortnight. I only use a fork to combine the eggs, sugar and vanilla,i find that that makes the brownie more fudgey.

AND it is just as good with out choc-chips if my pantry is ever a bit lacking on the chocolate front :)]]></description>
