					<description><![CDATA[when jeremy cooks naan, he use 2/3 of a cup of yoghurt in the mix. its interesting that your recipe is quite different!

jeremey&#039;s naan bread
2/3 cup greek/natural yoghurt
1 cup hot water
2t yeast
4 cups plain/bread flour
2t salt
2 cloves garlic (finely chopped)
pinch of chilli flakes

mix yogurt, water and yeast together and then let stand for 10 minutes.
mix in other ingredients.
stand for 10 minutes then 30 sec kneed on bench in oil (not flour) (repeat if you have time to improve texture)
let sit for 6 hours (enables dough to sour).
divide in 12 portions (without knocking the air out) and roll into balls. place on an oiled tray.
leave sit for 1 hour.
gently stretch out ball of dough and dry fry in a non-stick pan. brush both sides with melted butter once cooked (whilst still in pan).
eat and enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita
I&#039;ve been on a quest to make dumplings when I came across your site.
I too love cooking &#038; at the moment am doing part time course learning to be a Chinese chef.
Any way an idea for you to make naan bread without having to use an oven, place a wok upside down over your biggest burner &#038; get it HOT.
Shape the naan in a big triangle , get a corner on far side to stick to wok &#038; stretch naan over wok. When that side is cooked rotate &#038; fold naan in half.
Keep cooking &#038; folding till you get the size you wont.Then brush butter over this &#038; keep warm in oven.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Everyone - glad to inform you of how to cook naan without a tandoor oven, let me know if you try it and whether it works in others ovens too. :)

Hi Steph - Thanks sooo much for the award, I love reading your blog too!

Hi Jackie - I hope it lives up to the other naan bread :) let me know, if you get a chance.

Hi Pablopabla - I would try closest to the element first - keeping an eye on it, as it can sometimes puff up too high and catch on the element. See if that works and if it burns it without cooking, try lower down. Let me know how it goes :)]]></description>
