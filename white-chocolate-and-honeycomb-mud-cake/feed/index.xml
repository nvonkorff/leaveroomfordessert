					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/white-chocolate-and-honeycomb-mud-cake/comment-page-1/#comment-4306&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Sarah

Thanks for your comment, and sorry for your troubles with the icing. It is a very temperamental icing, I have different problems each time I make it.

I find that if the icing is too warm, the cream won&#039;t thicken and just stays sloppy, but sometimes when I cool it too much (put it in the fridge or add cold cream), it can split. When mine had split, I had to heat it slightly in the microwave and then cool it again. Recently after making it, I left it at room temperature for 30min - 1 hour (without the cold cream) and then I could beat it to nice peaks.

I hope this helps, as I know your frustration.

Cheers Anita]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made the cake which is now in the oven...but had more cake mix than would fit in 22cm (9 inch) cake pan.  Put the rest in small tin which I&#039;m imagining will cook more quickly.  Hope to taste it before we bring to dinner gathering this evening.  Anyone else have this happen?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m trying very hard to make your gorgeous looking White Chocolate and Honeycomb Mud Cake. The cake itself is ok but I can&#039;t get my ganache to go all white and fluffy. It looks like yours does in the first picture but won&#039;t thicken. I am using good quality chocolate and thickened cream. I live in Australia and used normal thickened cream so I&#039;m wondering if that&#039;s the problem or if you can guess at what else it could be. I so want to successfully make this cake and ganache.

If there is any advice you can give or could you tell me what brand chocolate and what type of cream you used. I&#039;d really appreciate it. I willing to try it a couple of times to get it right. Thanks!]]></description>
