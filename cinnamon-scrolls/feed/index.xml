					<description><![CDATA[These look lovely Anita!  And the flowers are beautiful too.  I love cinnamon sc/rolls...I have also found you can freeze them immediately after putting them onto the tray.  Then when you are ready to bake, place the tray and frozen scrolls straight into the oven (off) the night before.  By the morning they have defrosted and risen, ready to bake.  YUM! :)]]></description>
