					<description><![CDATA[I made these yesterday and they are so yummy! I was really surprised at how big 100g of grated chocolate was though - almost a bowlful.

And friand batter is so yummy - so fudgy and chocolately and cinnamony! And because there are no egg yolks in it, i feel completely justified in eating it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have heard of friands but never made them.  This sounds like a great recipe and a great way to use up those left over egg whites I have when I make pastry cream.  They look delicious!]]></description>
