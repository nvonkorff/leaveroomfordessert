					<description><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, glad you all liked the recipe and hope I&#039;ve inspired some of you to make it :) 

Hi Beta Gal - Bacon you say?! I love bacon, it could make almost anything better :)

Hi Alexandra - I&#039;m a hoarder of recipes too... now I just have to try and organise myself a bit better.

Hi Steph - I think it would wonderfully with filo pastry too.
