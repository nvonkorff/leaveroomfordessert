					<description><![CDATA[this looks amazing and i plan to make one myself for christmas this year:)
but im a bit confused about the assembling if the croquembouche.
did you use a cone to assemble this one? if so how does it stand and stay together
and if i wanted to use a croquembouche cone how would i go about assembling it, ive heard you&#039;re meant to place the profiteroles inside the cone, but how would you get it out afterwards wouldnt it be stuck because you have to use toffee to stick it to the inside of the cone?
haha i need help!
thankyou!:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Probably one of the few males who have read this and being an absolute bum amateur, I measured all the bits out for the vanilla cream (actually I used Kalua), got most of the way with cooking the stuff to a nice consistency and noticed a small plate with 200g of butter on it.

As is my wont I used lots of culinary terms about my efforts as a cook but try as I might there was no indication as to when and where the butter is used?  So I left it out.

Tomorrow afternoon I will be constructing the ediface.  If it all falls flat at least I can blame the lack of butter!!

Coach me please!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your croquembouche looks fantastic, I bet it tasted devine! 
I made an attempt on a croquembouche yesterday, It certainly didn&#039;t look as spectacular as yours, I had some trouble with the profiteroles, after they can out of the oven they went flat and soft losing all of their puff. I admit I used a different recipe as I didn&#039;t want to make as many, so the recipe I used made only about 20 puffs, what do you think was the reason for the deflated puffs?
I hope you can help me... regardless it tasted awesome!]]></description>
