					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita, just wanted to say how much I appreciate all of the effort you put into replicating these Masterchef desserts.  I watched the last episodes of MC Australia&#039;s season 4 (finally, on a regular non-premium station here in Italy!), and enjoyed the finale.  Long story short, while I was searching the recipes, I came across the V8 cake (of which I&#039;ve never seen the episode) and ended up at your blog since I was looking for HELP!  Needless to say, I want to give it a go as soon as I&#039;m able to source the ingredients.  Keep up the great work!]]></description>
