					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita - I love the Bacon, mushroom and spinach combination - the dish almost looks like a risotto to me!  But even better because it takes less time to  cook and sounds more forgiving than rice!  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks like a very refined cuisine for me. Love to try it with the normal couscous cause that is all I could find here in Bangkok.

Anyway, the dish is really fabulous. Thanks for sharing :-)

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post and really nice presentations of your dishes. 

I wondered how much like large pearl tapioca this is? Thought of it when I saw your dessert dish.

I have been making a lot of dishes with fregola- which is wonderful in savory dishes.]]></description>
