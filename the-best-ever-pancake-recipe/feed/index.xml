					<description><![CDATA[Hi Everyone and thanks for all your lovely comments.

Glad everyone liked the bowl and some have other bowls/plates etc that also have recipes.

Hi Parita - Thanks, banana would be great with them

Hi Arwen - Hahahaha, I know what you mean, that&#039;s a little silly :P

Hi Lorraine - Yes, &quot;best ever&quot; is very subjective, I found that out just two days ago when people were choosing their favourite profiterole.

Hi Tina - I would be interested to see if that was a good recipe 

Hi Rudy - I bought the bowl from Peters of Kensington (in Sydney). I bought it a few years ago, and Peters of Kensington still have some of the Primo &quot;Best Ever&quot; range on their website, although not the pancake bowl. Perhaps check with them if they are still stocking it. Hope that helps :)]]></description>
