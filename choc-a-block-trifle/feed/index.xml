					<description><![CDATA[Is it possible to scramble the egg mixture when adding the hot cream? My cream/white choc mixture came out tasting very eggy... but it was perfectly smooth... maybe the eggs I used were a bit too big. I have added extra white choc and a bit of vanilla extract and put it in the fridge to set, fingers crossed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/choc-a-block-trifle/comment-page-1/#comment-1794&quot;&gt;Joanne&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Joanne
Yes, cornflour and cornstarch are the same. In Australia it&#039;s called cornflour.
Thanks for visiting!

					<description><![CDATA[I am shamelessly drooling. These individual trifles would be a perfect make-ahead dessert for a dinner party. How can anyone resist brownies, white chocolate, cream, and Kahlua?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The picture with all the individual servings lined up is great - but I think I would have sugar overload just having all those glasses so close by.  :) I don&#039;t remember seeing that recipe in Delicious last year, but there are so many.  I end up with so many tags on pages that I want to come back to later.  I always have way too much to try!!!]]></description>
