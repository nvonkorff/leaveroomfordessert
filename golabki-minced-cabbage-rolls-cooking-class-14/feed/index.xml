					<description><![CDATA[My grandmother from Austria and my grandfather being polish, luckily my mother makes &quot;gawonkys&quot;. Since I&#039;m an adult now she ALWAYS puts some aside and freezes them for me. Oh...I can make them quite well but MY family hates them, or at least the cabbage. I find myself craving polish and Ukrainian food. Which makes me wonder if its genetic. Now that I&#039;m in my 40&#039;s I find myself wanting my children to learn some of these traditions. My mother said my grandmother was very quiet and didn&#039;t pass along alot of recipes and she passed very young so I appreciate these recipes. Next family gathering I think a polish/ukranian meal will be on the menu!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, we make these all the time, but I have to say we have never ever used cotton or toothpicks - they tend to stay together well enough anyway. And that reduces the hassle!

Do you know which region of Poland your family recipe comes from??

We never brown them, nor does any of our Polish friends - but they are all from the same region as my babcia.  They either steam them in the pan we first did the cabbage in or oven bake them in sauce. 

Still, these do look delicous!]]></description>
