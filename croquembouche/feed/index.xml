					<description><![CDATA[Anita, have just discovered your blog. WOW, so entertaining and informative! Auntie Google led me here whilst researching the possibility of making a crochembouche for my son&#039;s wedding arvo tea prior to reception. But I think I&#039;ll make more than one. There are 250 guests!! Fortunately the wedding isn&#039;t until Feb &#039;13. Hey, have you got any great ideas for other French provincial inspired goodies?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG this looks amazing thank you so much for posting your ideas as I haven&#039;t been game enough to try it. Can you please tell me without using the cone tin do you just stack them on top of each other so that its not hollow in the middle of the cone as such?? And roughly how many puffs are there in your croquembouche.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/croquembouche/comment-page-1/#comment-2823&quot;&gt;Eliduh&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Eliduh
It took a lot longer than 90 minutes for me. Although I wasn&#039;t rushing or multi-tasking as much as I could have. If you have the chance I would recommend making the pastry cream the night before, or making a smaller quantity of everything.
Good luck!
