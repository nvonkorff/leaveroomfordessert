					<description><![CDATA[Hi All

Hi Arwen - I&#039;m looking forward to making the hazelnut version too, I&#039;m just trying to find time and a reason to make it (after Easter, I think I&#039;ve made too much :)

Hi Sara - Thanks, this really was a delicious cake.

Hi Simon - Yep, it is definitely an artery filler :)

Hi Lorraine - Thanks, the icing drips weren&#039;t meant to be drips... it was meant to cover the cake... :) glad it looks good though :)

Hi Barbara - It was quite dense and moist and very delicious!

Hi Maria - Thanks, the cake wasn&#039;t as sweet as I thought it might be, the icing was quite sweet (and I made less icing) :)]]></description>
