					<description><![CDATA[This looks amazing! I&#039;ve never made a tart before and suddenly have to make one for a dinner party over the weekend; I thought this one sounded easier than one that completely needed baking - though I&#039;m curious as to what actually holds together the praline to stop it oozing everywhere, given the fact there doesn&#039;t seem to be any ingredients to set it, such as eggs... I&#039;m guessing the hazelnuts have some form of structural element, so hopefully it, er, holds up for me. (Perhaps I should stop over thinking things!) ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s in my never ending pile/list of recipes to make too! (But I need a special occasion for that one)
I actually recognised it from the cover before you even said it was from Gourmet Traveler - so you have obviously done a beautiful job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anita, you have done an amazing job.  This looks so decadently rich and delicious.  I immediately noticed that cover recipe, too.  It is sitting in my pile for later in the year to make.  I have strange &#039;lists&#039; of recipes to make.  I wish you could have sent some of the left overs up to me!!!]]></description>
