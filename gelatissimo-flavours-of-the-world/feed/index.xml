					<description><![CDATA[Wow I am jealous! They all look SO good...can you believe I have never yet had the pleasure of trying gelato? The French CrÃ¨me Brulee certainly sounds the most appealing, but I would certainly love to also try the Swiss Toblerone and the Thai Mango and Coconut!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember trying gelatissimo in queensland, and boy was it good. I wish I could have a free sample sent to me! I know there is a store here in melbourne, but I havent had a chance to swing by and get some more icecream goodness!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We used to always hit up Hornsby Gelatissimo and order the 8 &quot;mini-flavours&quot; which was supposed to be 8 teeny tiny scoops of the flavours of your choice, something like $7-8 including a wafer. The trick was to get one of the kids to serve you because they would just use the regular scoop and we would have way too much ice cream for just two people. I like to think they removed it from the menu because of us :P

That limoncello flavour looks pretty enticing though mmmm]]></description>
