					<description><![CDATA[During Easter, my son would always ask me to make a little something for him to take to his friends. As far as the little ones are concerned they are just happy to receive a basket full of toys or sweets. =)
My favourite treat to make for the kids are chocolate nests made of cornflakes and fill them up with colourful jelly beans and mini chocolate eggs. You definitely will see that unusual sparkle in their eyes which is priceless!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Favourite thing to buy??? Ummmm CHOCOLATE!!!!! What else??? Itâ€™s the only time of the year when chocolate miraculously becomes completely calorie free and you can indulge to your heartâ€™s content! 
Chocolate eggs, cream filled chocolate eggs, chocolate filled chocolate eggs.... speaking of Eggs...Why did the Easter Bunny have to fire the duck? Because he kept quacking all the eggs! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During easter, i love to make creme brulee. When all my friends and family come over to my home my sister and i like to make creme brulee for them to eat. We use the recipe which was presented on masterchef and everybody loves it! i also like to buy some chocolate and melt it and dip marshmallows and strawberrys and bananas in. thats usually what everybody tries to eat before its gone. I usually make my favourite chocolate brownies too. My own recipe. And last year, easter came on the day of my bestfriends 12th birthday, so i made him all of the above treats. HE LOVED IT! :D]]></description>
