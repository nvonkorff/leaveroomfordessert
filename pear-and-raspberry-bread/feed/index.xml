					<description><![CDATA[I work in a cafe and admit that the pear and raspberry bread we sell is my absolute guilty pleasure, but it is nothing compared to your recipe!
It was so beautiful and moist, with just the right ratio of ingredient&#039;s, alot lighter than the cafe bought bread to, so i didnt feel quite as naughty!
fantastic served toasted with a dollop of greek yogurt and some more fresh raspberries. The ones coming out of the hunter valley at the moment are just delish.
So happy i stumbled upon your blog, its added to my daily to do list now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there 
I just found your recipe by accident after surfing the net.  What I loved is the amazing photographs and blog with the recipe.  I have just made this lovely recipe pear and raspberry loaf (it&#039;s actually in the oven now).  The house smells incredible.  The kids and I have already licked the beaters and the spoon.  I cannot wait to have a slice.  I now want to see what other recipes you have on your site.  Thank you - your amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yummy.  I love pear, too.  This would be such a great breakfast.  Like Steph says above, funny how people call it a bread (instead of cake) to maybe make it sound healthier.  All in moderation, right!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Lorraine - It sure is the time to go pear crazy :P . A pear and cheddar loaf sounds very interesting, did it work well?

Hi Simon - It was nice and moist, although did lose a little of that with storing.

Hi Steph - Hehe, I know... they are much more like cakes then breads... :P

Hi Alexandra - I hope you get a chance to try it, it&#039;s lovely. I see it at heaps of places near where I live and work.

Hi Y - Yep.... I can just remember the flavours... perhaps time I make another one.

Hi Maria - It tastes fantastic warm with a bit of butter, hope you get a chance to try it!

Hi Ann - Thanks, it is yummy, I&#039;m glad I was introduced to the recipe :)]]></description>
