					<description><![CDATA[The sweet yeast dough was so soft and beautiful to work with. Really love this dough. I got confused with the word &#039;coffee&#039; when we had a class on &#039;coffee scrolls&#039; but yes..no coffee in it; just that it&#039;s meant to be served with coffee/tea/hot chocolate :)

My reaction was more of &#039;Bread again?&quot; We&#039;ve been baking bread every week since the start of the semester and every class, I had to take home 40 rolls/buns + 4 -5 large loaves each - white, pasta duras, olive loaves, sourdough and even rye.

Still...a very tasty challenge! :)

					<description><![CDATA[(Tell me it isn&#039;t so....does anyone really think there&#039;s coffee in  coffee cake??)
Anyway...this has been an intriguing challenge. I&#039;ve loved what all of you have done and the idea of a meringue layer sounds wonderful.
A great job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too put mine in the fridge overnight and even though I took it out for a bit the next morning I didn&#039;t feel like it rose as much as it would have the night before. And I had a watery, gooey mass of filling on the pan in the morning. It wasn&#039;t too bad, just like molten lava when it came out of the oven. Nice job on the challenge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Coffee cake is a misleading name haha. Despite the meringue leaking out, your cake looks lovely, and it still got a fair bit of heigh during baking. Chocolate and nuts are the perfect combination!]]></description>
