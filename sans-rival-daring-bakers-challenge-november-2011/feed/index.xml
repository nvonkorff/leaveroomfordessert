					<description><![CDATA[I have had great success with the recipe on the side of the sunbeam mixed dried fruit packet.  I changed the alcohol to tokay (because we like it) and I add some extra glace cherries.  I think the recipe is pretty flexible, but also very quick and easy.  Everyone who likes fruit cake seems to like it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, beautiful flowers and Sans Rival! I too feel like every weekend fills up quickly this time of year so it is difficult sometimes to squeeze these challenges in. Your profiteroles sound like they will be delicious. Nice job on the challenge!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry I don&#039;t get around to your blog as often as I would like - you are a marvelous baker! Your Sans Rival looks fabulous as do your flowers - such gorgeous colours! I always make a boiled fruit cake ( I have a great recipe, if you would like it) and prefer to use Captain Morgan rum which gives great flavour.  Have a blessed Christmas!]]></description>
