					<description><![CDATA[That is an amazing photo!!! I mean anyone reading this must be drooling.
Copying the recipe now. My kids will love nibbling on these. 
I think you could crush them and add them to ice cream, a panna cotta...I can think of lots of things to do with them.
Kudos!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, they look great and delicious!!!
 I love Vienna almonds too and the smells of the QVB nut shop is sooo good, I bought some from it several times and my dad also love their caramelised macadamia. Is the nuts shop still in there, as I haven&#039;t seen it last time I went there, or do anybody know where I can find the shop now?

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahha, so you have to roast the almonds first.  I think that was my problem.  I didn&#039;t measure the temperature either, so mine were a little overdone.  It&#039;s nice to have a proper recipe, and I look forward to hearing your next one!]]></description>
