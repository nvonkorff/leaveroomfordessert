					<description><![CDATA[oh yum, this quiche looks so fluffy and cheesy. I LOVe quiche, regardless of its eggy-ness. I&#039;ve never had one with capsicum before though, this does sound interesting]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks lovely.  I&#039;d be hard put to choose between bacon and pumpkin, but pumpkins are so sweet at the moment I think it would win.  Poor Nick grating the butter - he must be very glad you bought a food processor!  I haven&#039;t seen a cream cheese pastry before.  Can you taste it?]]></description>
