					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anita,
 I&#039;m George Francisco and this is my signature dish! I was the chef of Jonahs at Whale beach. I appreciate that you have given them some credit but this dish is mine and I have been cooking it before I was the chef there. You have done this pretty well! I am surprised you didnt quite get the mould right because you said you tried this at Taste of Sydney and I taught it there. I can help you with this if you like. Also the secret of the nipple. I like it the speckled way you have done it but I can tell you one slight difference to get it perfect. I am very impressed that you made the mould and worked out the problems. 
I am now the chef of Roberts Circa 1876 and Restaurant Eighty Eight at Peppers Convent in the Hunter Valley. I still serve this dessert so if anyone is interested come in and try it. The Sydney Morning Herald just listed it as one of the years best desserts in the 2015 Good Food Guide. 
I am very happy that you ranked this dessert good enough to copy! Thank you!! Please feel free to mention me as the creator. :)]]></description>
