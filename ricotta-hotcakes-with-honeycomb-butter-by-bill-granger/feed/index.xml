					<description><![CDATA[Hey Anita, Great post! I just made these for Valentines brunch and they were delicious. They were last minute so I didn&#039;t make the honeycomb butter so we just ate them with maple syrup and they were fab.
These will probably be my basic pancake recipe from now on. The ricotta makes all the difference hey?]]></description>
