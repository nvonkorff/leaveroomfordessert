					<description><![CDATA[Hi, a couple of tips to improve your recipe if you want a more ferrero rocher style.
1 . add some dutch style coco powder to the milk mixture.
2. Roast a few hazelnuts and place in a food processor while still warm and blend until still a little crunchy.
3. add some freshly toasted shredded coconut to the blender with the hazelnuts.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there readers, thanks for the comments and visiting, hope you liked the gelato

Hi Trisha - hahha, I still haven&#039;t made 1/4 of the things I want to in the ice cream machine.. hopefully this summer - fingers crossed.

Hi Dan - Thanks!

Hi Grace - I agree, it is a fantastic way to eat Nutella

Hi Anita - I would love the attachment for my KitchenAid too. I have a Krumps ice cream machine model, although the paddle has broken and costs a heap to get replaced and sent out, so I&#039;m not sure what to do about it. This is the Gourmet Traveller tart and it was fantastic. I just tried the Aria one and it was a bit too rich for me.

Hi Lorraine - I think that&#039;s what happened to me the first time too. This is a good quantity of Nutella

Hi Arwen - I have tried to go for ones with less egg yolks and more cream in the past and they have been heavy and too creamy. This was quite nice although, although because it was too hot for my ice cream maker I had to do it by hand anyway... The recipe on MasterChef MasterClass used around 8 egg yolks for a similar quantity, so I&#039;d like to see what that turns out like.

Hi Simon - :) Thanks

Hi Anh - Good luck, hope you love it.

Hi Julia - Hahahaha, yep, no excuse.

Hi Maria - It&#039;s fantastic!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anita, this looks lovely.  I don&#039;t remember that recipe - will have to get my magazine to check.  I was JUST thinking that I don&#039;t use my ice-cream bowls enough.  I have two.  You think I would have no excuse, right?  Particularly with all those egg whites I use up with macarons.  Plenty of yolks hanging around not wanting to be wasted.  This is now ON THE LIST!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had trouble with very heavy rich icecreams too, and I thought it must be because of the churning process in a home icecream maker.  If it&#039;s only the recipe then that&#039;s good news.  This recipe still has a lot of egg yolks, but maybe more milk:cream than the ones I&#039;ve tried.  How different is it to your other ones?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oooh yummy! Sounds like you&#039;re ready for Spring already :D I tried making this once but it wasn&#039;t as nice as yours. I think I added too much Nutella and it wouldn&#039;t freeze well enough lol]]></description>
