					<description><![CDATA[I would love someone to place that plate in front of me! It&#039;s beaautiful. Those colors! There&#039;s nothing like fresh fruit and it&#039;s fun to use the pomegrante arils- such a burst of flavor as well as being pretty.
Your chicken is flavored perfectly. This looks complicated, but when you read through, it really isn&#039;t!
Super meal, Anita!]]></description>
