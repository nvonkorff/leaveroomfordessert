					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for your recipe because it saved me! I went to make the Masterchef one but couldn&#039;t find guava anywhere and the custard apples weren&#039;t ripe so I went with your version instead and it was AMAZING! Took me close to three hours to do but so worth it when you see the end result and the look on everyone&#039;s face when they&#039;re eating what you made makes it all worth it. Thanks again for sharing =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Howdi ... any one out there tried to make these in New Zealand and has any one successfully sourced the liquid Maltose?  Am heading to my local Asian store today but as I am in a small town not sure whether I will be lucky.  Tried liquid amber malt to no success, so don&#039;t waste your funds on that.

The rest of the recipe is great.  in a fit of excitement I upturned my sugar in to the whties before I realised I should not have.  I just beat these for a little longer than i normally would and the meringue turned out great.  I don&#039;t have hemisphere moulds but turned my silicone muffin tins inside out and this worked well.

I will fudge the tuilles for this evenings event as I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be so lucky with the maltose and think I&#039;ll have to go the glucose route.  But if anyone has luck with the maltose in NZ pleae let me know.

Many thanks]]></description>

Hi Steph
It certainly sounds similar - but I can&#039;t be positive - sorry. You could always give it a go if it&#039;s not too expensive. Just make the tuilles in advance - they keep well for a week or so.]]></description>
