					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments :)

Lorraine - I think the soaking is just to soften the seeds a little, I&#039;m not sure whether it makes much difference to the flavour.

Barbara - Thanks, My mum certainly did enjoy her cake (and the rest of her birthday dinner).

Arwen - The subtle icing is lovely and not too overpowering like some of the ones at the shops.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting idea Anita about soaking the poppyseeds. I&#039;ve never done that before, I&#039;ve just used them straight in a recipe. Does it change the cake very much? It looks great and  I agree real Orange juice is better than the flavouring :)]]></description>
